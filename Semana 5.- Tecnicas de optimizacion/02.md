###Eager loading

  - `.includes(:association_names, :another_one, …)`
    It specifies the relationships to be included in the result:

    ```ruby
      contacts = Contact.includes(:address)

      contacts.each do |contact|
        puts contact.address.try(:street)
      end
    ```

    _With includes you can access the address relationship without doing n+1 queries_

    you could do amazing things with includes, for example, you could get more associations, even associations of the associations of our model, example:

    ```ruby
      contacts = Contact.includes(:phones, { address: [:country] })

      contacts.each do |contact|
        puts contact.address.country.name
        puts contact.phones.first.phone_number
      end
    ```

    But...

    maybe you'll want to get all states by a country name:

    ```ruby
      > State.includes(:country).where(countries: { name: 'México' })
      SQL (0.4ms)  SELECT "states"."id" AS t0_r0, "states"."country_id" AS t0_r1,
                          "states"."name" AS t0_r2, "states"."created_at" AS t0_r3,
                          "states"."updated_at" AS t0_r4, "countries"."id" AS t1_r0,
                          "countries"."name" AS t1_r1, "countries"."created_at" AS t1_r2,
                          "countries"."updated_at" AS t1_r3
                   FROM "states"
                   LEFT OUTER JOIN "countries" ON "countries"."id" = "states"."country_id"
                   WHERE "countries"."name" = ?  [["name", "México"]]
    ```

    In this case activerecord is a little bit smart (kind of), it knows we want to do a join with the countries table.

  - `.preload(:association_names, :another_one, …)` Preload behave like includes, but the main difference is that preload always make a separated query.

  - `.eager_load(:association_name, :another_one)`
    Forces eager loading by performing a LEFT OUTER JOIN on associations

    Sometimes we have to find all the records of the second table in a single query, well, this is the way to go.

    ```ruby
      > y = Country.eager_load(:states)
        # SQL (0.8ms)  SELECT "countries"."id" AS t0_r0, "countries"."name" AS t0_r1,
        "countries"."created_at" AS t0_r2, "countries"."updated_at" AS t0_r3,
        "states"."id" AS t1_r0, "states"."country_id" AS t1_r1,
        "states"."name" AS t1_r2, "states"."created_at" AS t1_r3,
        "states"."updated_at" AS t1_r4 FROM "countries"
        LEFT OUTER JOIN "states" ON "states"."country_id" = "countries"."id"
    ```

###Exercises

Our client wants a module where you can administer countries and states where they have operations, also they want to manage their clients/contacts but this application could be used by thousands of people arround the countries and states where they have offices

- Create a `Contact` model, controller (scaffolds allowed) with the following structure:

  `name:string nickname:string avatar:string email:string`

- Create an address model, controller (scaffolds allowed)

  `contact:references country:references state:references street:string zipcode:string address_type:integer is_default:boolean`

  - Don't forget to edit the migration and set a default value to `is_default` to false, and `address_type` to 0

- Create a phone model, controller (scaffolds allowed) with the following structure

  `contact:references phone_type:integer phone_number:string is_default:boolean`

- Create a social_network model, controller (scaffolds allowed) with the following structure

  `contact:references network_type:integer link:string`
